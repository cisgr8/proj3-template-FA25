This is where you will write your work log.  

You should write one worklog entry for each working session (a few hours of work).

Each entry should be a maximum of 2 paragraphs or 10 bullets. (About 300 words in total or less.)
Write concise, thoughtful, short sentences.  Avoid unnecessary words.
The quality of your writing will have an impact on your grade.
For each working session, describe:
     (1) summarize the actions you took in this work session (what you did) 
     (2) summarize what you learned  
For full credit, include unique details
Vague general entries will receive zero or low credit
